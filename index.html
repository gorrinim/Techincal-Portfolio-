  <h2>Thunderbikes</h2>
  <div class="project">
    <p>During my time with Thunderbikes, I worked on several key projects that combined innovative design, analysis, and hands-on manufacturing. I utilized photogrammetry data to create CAD models of the front cowling for a high-performance electric motorcycle, which was used for mounting structures and CFD simulations. From these simulations, I derived boundary conditions for FEA to validate and iterate on the mounting structure, optimizing it for weight and manufacturability. The final design was built entirely in-house and mounted on the motorcycle for competition.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I designed and fabricated composite parts, including the tooling, while leading material testing to evaluate the compatibility of tooling material and epoxies, as well as vacuum behavior. The tooling for the part was built entirely in-house using a CNC router and hand sculpting. We created foam geometries and developed layup schedules for composite components, guiding a team in their construction through wet layup and vacuum bagging. These projects allowed me to apply engineering principles to real-world challenges while refining my skills in design, analysis, and manufacturing.</p>

  <h2>Supermileage</h2>
  <div class="project">
    <p>During my time with the Supermileage team, I worked on several projects that pushed the boundaries of composite material applications. I conducted mechanical tests on composite samples, consolidating the results to derive material properties for FEA simulations. These properties were critical for our chassis design team, enabling more accurate performance predictions. I also performed multiple flat panel vacuum infusions to produce high-quality samples for testing, refining my understanding of composite fabrication techniques.</p>
    <p>One of these projects was experimenting with multi-matrix composite parts, where I developed a lightweight composite hinge to replace traditional steel and aluminum mechanisms. This project allowed me to combine material science and design optimization, showcasing the potential of composites for weight reduction without compromising functionality. These experiences helped me develop a deeper understanding of composites, from fabrication to performance evaluation.</p>

  <h2>RC Car</h2>
  <div class="project">
    <p>While working on the RC car project, I collaborated with a team of five students to design and build a fully functional prototype featuring aluminum wheels, a carbon fiber chassis, custom bodywork, and a functional rear wing. I conducted CFD simulations to optimize the rear wing and bodywork for maximum downforce and minimal drag, iterating through multiple designs to refine performance.</p>
    <p>For the carbon fiber chassis, we designed parts and tooling, leading the fabrication process through wet layups and vacuum bagging. Additionally, I designed both the part and the tooling for the PETG thermoformed car bodywork. Beyond design and manufacturing, we carried out market research and developed a production system to determine the best manufacturing processes for a 20,000-unit production run. I also addressed performance challenges by selecting and applying lubricants to reduce mechanical vibrations and improve drivetrain efficiency.</p>
